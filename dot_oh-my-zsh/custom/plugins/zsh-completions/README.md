**Additional completion definitions for [Zsh](http://www.zsh.org).**

This project aggregates zsh completions from:
1. [zsh-users/zsh-completions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions)
2. [zchee/zsh-completions](https://github.com/zchee/zsh-completions)
3. [nilsonholger/osx-zsh-completions](https://github.com/nilsonholger/osx-zsh-completions)
4. and *various* other [custom] or third-party sources.

*This projects aims at gathering/developing new completion scripts that are not available in Zsh yet. The scripts may be contributed to the Zsh project when stable enough.*
