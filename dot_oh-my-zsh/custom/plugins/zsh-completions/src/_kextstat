# KEXTSTAT(8)               BSD System Manager's Manual              KEXTSTAT(8)
#
# NAME
#      kextstat -- display status of loaded kernel extensions (kexts)
#
# SYNOPSIS
#      kextstat [-a] [-h] [-k] [-l] [-b identifier] ...
#
# DESCRIPTION
#      The kextstat utility displays the status of any kexts currently loaded in the kernel.  The following information is shown for each loaded kext:
#
#      Index     The load index of the kext (used to track linkage references).  Gaps in the list indicate kexts that have been unloaded.
#
#      Refs      The number of references to this kext by others.  If nonzero, the kext cannot be unloaded.
#
#      Address   The address in kernel space where the kext has been loaded.
#
#      Size      The number of bytes of kernel memory that the kext occupies.  If this is zero, the kext is a built-in part of the kernel that has a record as a kext for resolving dependencies
#                among kexts.
#
#      Wired     The number of wired bytes of kernel memory that the kext occupies.
#
#      Architecture (if the -a option is used)
#                The architecture of the kext.
#
#      Name      The CFBundleIdentifier of the kext.
#
#      (Version)
#                The CFBundleVersion of the kext.
#
#      <Linked Against>
#                The index numbers of all other kexts that this kext has a reference to.
#
# OPTIONS
#      These options are available:
#
#      -a, -arch
#                Print the architecture of the kext.
#
#      -b identifier, -bundle-id identifier
#                Display the status of only the kext with the given bundle identifier.  This option trumps the -no-kernel option; if both are given and a kernel component is specified, its
#                information is shown.
#
#      -h, -help
#                Print a help message describing each option flag and exit with a success result, regardless of any other options on the command line.
#
#      -k, -no-kernel
#                Don't show information for built-in components of the kernel.
#
#      -l, -list-only
#                Print the list of loaded kexts only and omit the header (useful for running output through text-analysis tools).
#
#      -s, -sort
#                Sort the list by load address.
#
# DIAGNOSTICS
#      The kextstat utility exits with a status of 0 on success and with a nonzero status if an error occurs.
